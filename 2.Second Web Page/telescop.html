        <h3>Telescopes</h3>
        <p>
            A telescope is a device used to observe distant objects by their emission, absorption, or reflection of
            electromagnetic radiation. Originally, it was an optical instrument using lenses, curved mirrors, or a
            combination of both to observe distant objects â€“ an optical telescope.
